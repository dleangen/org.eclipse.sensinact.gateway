Eclipse sensiNact is an Open Source integration framework for Smart Cities.

Although sensiNact can be used in various IoT settings, 
it is particularly useful for Smart City applications. Our approach is to be technology agnostic
in order to integrate virtually any IoT technology, and the platform
is optimized for the collection, analysis, and visualization of massive quantities of data.

If you are new to sensiNact, we recommend that you read our [User Guide](user-guide/index.md).

To get up and running right away, see the [Quick Start](getting-started/index.md) Guide.

Technical information can be found in the [Developer Guide](developer-guide/index.md)
and the [Javadocs](javadoc.md).
