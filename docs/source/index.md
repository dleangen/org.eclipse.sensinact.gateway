Eclipse sensiNact is an Open Source framework for IoT.
It's primary purpose is to provide an environment in which heterogeneous devices can exchange information.

It is a horizontal platform dedicated to IoT and in particularly used in various smart city and smart home applications.
Eclipse sensiNact aims at managing IoT protocols and devices heterogeneity and provides synchronous (on demand) and asynchronous (periodic or event based) access to data/actions of IoT devices, as well as access to historic data with generic and easy-to-use API.


```{admonition} Note from David
We should consider rewriting the introduction, which is perhaps the most important section of the doc.

We may want to consider explaining:
 - What is the actual primary purpose of sensiNact?
 - What are the most important secondary goals?
 - Whom is this platform intended for?
 - Why would you want to use it?
 
 And so on.

## Getting Started

```{admonition} Note from David
Not sure yet how to organize this part of the doc...
TBD
```

The following examples will help you to quickly get started with the sensiNact gateway:

* [Downloading and Launching](examples/Download.md) - See how to download and start sensiNact
* [Configuring and Querying](examples/Configuring.md) - See how to change sensiNact's configuration and access the REST interface
* [Interacting with a southbound device](examples/Interacting.md) - See how to read a device's data, change editable fields, and listen for updates.
* Building your own Southbound Provider - TODO
