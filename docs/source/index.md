Eclipse sensiNact is an Open Source Gateway framework for Smart Cities.

Although sensiNact can be used in various IoT settings, such as smart home applications,
it is particularly useful for Smart City applications. Our approach to the Internet of Things
is optimized for the collection, analysis, and visualization of massive quantities of data.

We strive to balance simplicity with practicality. Smart City applications can be very complex,
so require support of a flexible and dynamic platform; at the same time, the complexity needs to
be manageable and consumable by people.
The sheer number and variety of devices also requires a practical means of quickly integrating all sorts
of data sources.


:::{admonition} Note from David
The intro should explain:
 - What is the actual primary purpose of sensiNact?
 - What are the most important secondary goals?
 - Whom is this platform intended for?
 - Why would you want to use it?
 
 And so on.

## Getting Started

:::{admonition} Note from David
Not sure yet how to organize this part of the doc...
TBD
:::

The following examples will help you to quickly get started with the sensiNact gateway:

* [Downloading and Launching](examples/Download.md) - See how to download and start sensiNact
* [Configuring and Querying](examples/Configuring.md) - See how to change sensiNact's configuration and access the REST interface
* [Interacting with a southbound device](examples/Interacting.md) - See how to read a device's data, change editable fields, and listen for updates.
* Building your own Southbound Provider - TODO
