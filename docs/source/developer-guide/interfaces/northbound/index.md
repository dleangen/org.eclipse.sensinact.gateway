# Northbound

![Users using Northbound providers to communicate with the Eclipse sensiNact Digital Twin](../../../_static/northbound/northbound-provider-white.png){.float-right w=20em}

The *northbound* interface of Eclipse sensiNact Gateway refers to the APIs that interface with applications.

Here, we use "application" quite generally. It could mean for example:
 * A simple view of a Report
 * An actual web application used by a user
 * A projection API for use by another machine

The main commonality is that it is generally an aggregation of data that is sourced by Things.
