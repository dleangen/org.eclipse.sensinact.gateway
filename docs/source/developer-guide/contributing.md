# Contributing

The way you contribute the sensiNact depends on whether or not you are a Committer.

## Non-Committers

We appreciate all contributions and encourage participation in the development of this exciting technology.

Contributions are accepted as pull requests (PRs) via [GitHub](https://github.com/eclipse/org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway).

Before submitting a PR, please ensure the following:

1. You have signed the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php).
2. You use the same email address as both the "author" and (if applicable) the "committer" in your git commits as you used to sign the ECA.
3. You remember to add “Signed-off-by: [Your Name] <[YOUR EMAIL]>” to *all* your commit messages.
   - Again, the name and email need to match the email used to sign the ECA.

The contribution process used by the sensiNact project is the relatively common GitHub triangular workflow:

1. **File an issue.**
   - This should always be the first step.
   - The issue can be about a problem, or a suggestion for an enhancement or improvement.
   - Discussions about the issue and why the change is needed can take place [here](https://github.com/sensiNact/issues).
   - You can wait for the discussion to resolve, or proactively submit your PR as part of the discussion.

2. **Fork the [sensiNact Repository](https://github.com/eclipse/org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway).**

3. **Create a Branch.**
   - The name of the branch should begin with your initials. For instance, a John Doe would use `jd/`.
   - After your initials, write the short name of the issue, for instance `bug-fix-330`, so: `jd/bug-fix-330`.

4. **Commit your Changes to this Branch.**
   - Whether or not to squash into a single commit, or to separate into multiple commits depends on the situation.
   - If in doubt, feel free to reach out to the community on the [mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/sensinact-dev).

5. **If Applicable, Add “Fixes #330” in one of the Commit Messages.**
   - Referring to the issue number that will be addressed by the commit(s).

6. **Submit the PR.**
   - Submit the change to the master branch.
   - How you submit the PR will depend on how you use git and GitHub.
   - If you are stuck, please reach out to the team via the [mailing list](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/sensinact-dev).

:::{admonition} Note from David
If the PR gets submitted to the master branch, then what is the point of creating a local branch like `dml/some-branch`?
:::

This workflow is available to anyone who wants to contribute to sensiNact. Those with a history of regular contributions may be invited to become committers. As a committer, you gain the ability to merge pull requests, and also to push branches directly into the sensiNact repository. This can allow you to avoid working across forks, but committers are still strongly discouraged from pushing directly to the master branch.
