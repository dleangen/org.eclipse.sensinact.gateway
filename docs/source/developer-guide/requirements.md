# Requirements

## System Requirements

Each version of sensiNact has its specific requirements. Please see the
[sensiNact GitHub page](https://github.com/eclipse/org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway)
for details.

:::{admonition} Note from David
I don't think the requirements are actually on GitHub yet.
I think that would be the best place to have them.

## Reader Level

This documentation is written for application developers, framework and system service developers (system developers), and
architects. The purpose is to provide information about what the system is, and how it can be used, as well as
how to install and operate the system, and how to develop extensions or add-ons.
For information about how to contribute to the development the actual platform, please see
our [Developer Guide](../developer-guide/index.md).

sensiNact is based on OSGi, so basic knowledge of OSGi and some compendium specifications
