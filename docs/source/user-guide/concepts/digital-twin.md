# Digital Twin

The [IoT Gateway](gateway.md) is the hub, but IoT would be meaningless without all the "things". These things
are real and live in the physical world. To make them manageable in the digital realm, they need to be represented
as data, and manipulated by software.

To this end, a "digital twin" refers to a virtual model or representation of a physical object, process, system, or service.
This concept is integral to modern IoT systems.

The idea is to have a virtual copy, or "twin", of each physical device within the IoT platform. The digital twin is like a driver;
it provides methods to access and optionally control the physical device. It also abstracts away much of the complexity
of the hardware. This approach allows the system to interact with the physical object as it would with any other
software, by calling well-known methods.

In the IoT field, "digital twin" is a well-known concept.
For consistency, sensiNact also uses this well-known idea as a core concept in the platform.
