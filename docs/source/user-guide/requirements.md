# Requirements

## System Requirements

Each version of sensiNact has its specific requirements. Please see the
[sensiNact GitHub page](https://github.com/eclipse/org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway)
for details.

:::{admonition} Note from David
I don't think the requirements are actually on GitHub yet.
I think that would be the best place to have them.

:::{admonition} Note from David
I am not at all satisfied with this section.
We need to explain, very clearly, who this documentation is for.
