# Requirements

## System Requirements

Each version of sensiNact has its specific requirements. Please see the
[sensiNact GitHub page](https://github.com/eclipse/org.eclipse.sensinact.gateway)
for details.

## Reader Level

This documentation is written for application developers, framework and system service developers (system developers), and
architects.

sensiNact is based on OSGi, so basic knowledge of OSGi and some compendium specifications
is necessary.
In addition to the requirements described in

readers should have basic knowledge of IoT.
