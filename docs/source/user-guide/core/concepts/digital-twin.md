# Digital Twin

A "digital twin" refers to a virtual model or representation of a physical object, process, system, or service.
This concept is integral to modern IoT systems.

The idea is to have a virtual copy of a physical device within the IoT platform. The digital twin is like a driver;
it provides methods to access and optionally control the physical device. It also abstracts away much of the complexity
of the hardware. This approach allows the system to interact with the physical object as it would with any other
software, by calling well-known methods.

In the IoT field, "digital twin" is a well-known concept.
For consistency, sensiNact also uses this well-known idea as a core concept in the platform.
