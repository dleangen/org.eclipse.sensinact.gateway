# Overview

Eclipse sensiNact is an Open Source integration framework for Smart Cities.

Originally conceived as an [IoT Gateway](concepts/gateway.md), sensiNact has evolved beyond the traditional scope of the Internet of Things. Today's IoT ecosystem encompasses a vast array of "things" and generates massive quantities of data. The challenge for Smart City operators is to effectively interpret and utilize this data to enhance the lives of citizens. The technology landscape is complex and often resource-intensive.

In this dynamic and challenging environment, sensiNact stands out as an optimal solution for open technology and interoperability.

## Why sensiNact?

sensiNact serves as a comprehensive integration hub:

* It integrates massive quantities of disparate data types from virtually any source.
* It connects a diverse range of [Things](concepts/index.md), enhancing IoT device interaction.
* It supports a wide array of [IoT protocols](concepts/protocols.md), ensuring seamless communication.
* It offers flexible and scalable architecture to adapt to evolving Smart City needs.
* It provides robust data processing and analytics capabilities for actionable insights.

Other advanced proprietary integration platforms, such as
[IBM Watson IoT Platform](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/)
and [Microsoft Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/iot-hub/),
exist in the market. However, for information consumers who value control, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, only an Open Source platform like sensiNact can truly deliver. 

Eclipse sensiNact is distributed under the [EPL](../license.md) license, offering operators, integrators, and developers the assurance and freedom they need in a rapidly advancing technological landscape.
