This section needs some love.

As of January 2024...

sensiNact is still in the Incubation phase. As such, we are working on the basic functionality of the system,
and the system is not yet ready for the public. For instance, we are seriously lacking documentation.

Recently, we launched a new version of sensiNact (v0.0.2).
While keeping the core data model, the main changes were to the threading and interaction models.

Please note that the legacy version (0.0.1) of sensiNact Studio is no longer supported.
The plan is to replace it by a Web UI.

Currently, the sensiNact applications are not supported.
