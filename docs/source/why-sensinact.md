# Why sensiNact?

There are a number of IoT platforms available, so why would you want to use sensiNact?

:::{admonition} Note from David
TBD. This page needs a lot of work.

I think it is an important page, that needs to describe:
 - the vision
 - what sets it apart from other platforms
 - why people should use it (and not something else)
 - the implicit contract (what sensiNact will do for you, now and in the future)

It should ideally be inspiring, and if we could have a call to action, that would
be great, too.
