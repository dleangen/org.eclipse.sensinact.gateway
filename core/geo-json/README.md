# Bundle `geo-json`

This is just a temporary place to capture initial notes regarding the `geo-json` bundle.

## Questions

* Why this spec, and not some other?
* Are there competing specs?
* How does this choice limit sensiNact?
* Could this be made into an OSGi-style spec?
* Could this not be made standalone, since this could be useful outside of sensiNact?
  ** Could be a form of "marketing" to have "IoT tools" available as OSS
  ** Shows that we really care about IoT and want to make the world better
* Why is geometry so important, as opposed to other attributes, to be in the Core?
* Why is the impl included in the same bundle as the API?


Points I do like:

* It is based on a spec, so it's not arbitrary


## Overview

This bundle provides an adapter API for the GeoJSON Format, as defined
by [RFC7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946).

The spec introduces GeoJSON as follows.

> GeoJSON is a geospatial data interchange format based on JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON).  It defines several types of JSON objects and
the manner in which they are combined to represent data about
geographic features, their properties, and their spatial extents.
GeoJSON uses a geographic coordinate reference system, World Geodetic
System 1984, and units of decimal degrees.

### General Acceptance

GeoJSON is a widely accepted format for communicating geospacial data in the fields of
geographic information systems (GIS), web mapping, and spatial data analysis.

* **Standardization**: GeoJSON has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in RFC 7946. The formalization of GeoJSON as an IETF standard is a strong indicator of its acceptance and reliability within the technical community.

* **Support by Major GIS and Mapping Platforms**: Major GIS software and web mapping platforms like ESRI's ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenLayers, and Leaflet support GeoJSON. This widespread support across industry-leading tools is a clear sign of its acceptance.

* **Usage in Open Source and Commercial Software**: GeoJSON is used in a wide range of both open source and commercial applications. This broad usage across different types of software projects signifies its general acceptance.

* **Community and Documentation**: There is a robust community around GeoJSON, with extensive documentation, tutorials, and forums. A strong community and wealth of resources are typical characteristics of a widely accepted technology.

* **Integration in Web Technologies**: GeoJSON is closely aligned with JSON, a cornerstone of modern web technologies, making it a natural choice for web-based GIS and mapping applications. Its compatibility with web standards further reinforces its wide acceptance.

* **Academic and Industry Research**: GeoJSON is frequently referenced in academic papers and industry research related to GIS, indicating its recognition and usage in scholarly and professional domains.

* **Use in Government and Public Sector**: Many government and public sector projects around the world use GeoJSON for spatial data representation, further underlining its acceptance in critical and high-standard sectors.

* **Ease of Use and Flexibility**: GeoJSON's simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for developers and GIS professionals, contributing to its widespread adoption.


## The Role of GeoJSON in sensiNact

Using GeoJSON within the Eclipse sensiNact Gateway platform makes sense for a number of reasons:

* **Location-Based Data Processing**: IoT devices often collect data related to their location or the location of monitored objects. GeoJSON provides a standardized way to represent this location data. For instance, an IoT gateway could aggregate data from multiple devices across a geographic area and represent this information in GeoJSON format for easy processing and analysis.

* **Spatial Analysis and Decision Making**: In many IoT applications, decisions are based on the spatial distribution of sensors and their readings. GeoJSON can be used to analyze patterns like temperature gradients in a city, traffic conditions, or resource distribution in agriculture. Northbound services attached to the gateway can process this spatial data and make decisions or trigger actions based on it.

* **Integration with GIS and Mapping Services**: IoT gateways often need to integrate with external GIS services for advanced mapping and analytics. GeoJSON, being a widely accepted format, facilitates this integration, allowing the gateway to easily exchange data with various GIS platforms.

* **Real-time Tracking and Monitoring**: For IoT applications involving real-time tracking (like vehicle or asset tracking), GeoJSON can be used to update and transmit the current locations of these assets. This is essential for logistics, fleet management, and emergency response systems.

* **Scalability and Interoperability**: GeoJSON's lightweight and text-based format ensures that it doesn't impose heavy data loads on the network, which is crucial in IoT environments where bandwidth might be limited. Its interoperability makes it suitable for diverse ecosystems of devices and applications.

* **Visualizing Sensor Networks**: GeoJSON can be used to visualize the locations and statuses of various IoT sensors on a map, which is beneficial for monitoring and managing large-scale sensor networks. It helps in identifying areas with faulty sensors or understanding environmental patterns impacting sensor readings.

* **Enhanced Contextual Information**: By using GeoJSON, IoT gateways can provide enriched contextual information. For instance, in a smart city scenario, sensor data could be combined with geographic information like street names, district boundaries, or points of interest.

* **Environment and Agricultural Applications**: In environmental monitoring or precision agriculture, where the geographic context is fundamental, GeoJSON can be used to represent data like soil moisture levels, pollutant distribution, or crop conditions across different geographical zones.
